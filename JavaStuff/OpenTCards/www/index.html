	<h1>Open T-Cards</h1>
	<p>
		Open T-Cards is a digital T-Cards implementation using Swing components and 
		standard serialization techniques to save and sort data used for task management.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following are some of the features that I plan on implementing.  The list is not 
		conclusive, though it is fairly complete.  I will try to keep it updated as feature 
		requests are accepted.  Though as the project is in its incubation stage currently, 
		I do not suspect that the list will change much in the near future.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>XML-based project files</li>
		<li>Project collections</li>
		<li>Single boards per project</li>
		<li>Multiple columns per board</li>
		<li>Unlimited cards per column</li>
		<li>Editable column labels</li>
		<li>Dynamic attribute lists for each card</li>
		<li>Ability to pre-set attribute lists for new cards</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The GUI is laid out using Swing and a combination of box and border layouts for layout management.  
		This project is fairly small at the moment, and so I don't really feel like I need much help. 
		Nonetheless, if you feel like you can add to the project, please feel free to request a role, and 
		let me know what your thoughts are.  Thank you.
