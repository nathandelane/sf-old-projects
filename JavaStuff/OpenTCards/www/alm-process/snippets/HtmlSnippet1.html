<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />This is an open source implementation in Java of the TCards project and task management system.  TCards is a panel that goes on a wall with t-shaped cards.  The reason for the t-shape is so that they don't fall through the panel (the panel is similar to a time card slot rack).  In this implementation the cards won't be t-shaped, but the idea and usage will be similar.

I plan to use XML as a data source.

My background is in J2SE.  I've been programming for hobby and for work using Java, Ruby, and other languages.  My experience though is mostly in Java using Swing for GUI implementation, and including packages from the Java core libraries, like net, io, awt, and so on to create desktop tools, console applications, and video games.  My most recent work is on a project called Encryption-Journal, which can be downloaded on code.google.com.  I am also working on the KPC project at sourceforge actively.
