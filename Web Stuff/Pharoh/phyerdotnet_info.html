					<p>To sum it all up. We are a hosting service that is also a community that provides competitive hosting solutions to artistic individuals that desire an online presence. But aside from just providing users with "storage space". We also provide them with the means to meet &amp; interact with other creative folks much like themselves.</p>
					<p>
						The plan by doing things this way. Is to help raise the user's own abilities to "network". With a wide array of artistic talents. Of various levels and skill types. Going with this approach. Users can create a chain of trusted references. Users could also form tightly knit groups. That could bring about things such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cross training of skills</li>
						<li>Assistance from other users</li>
						<li>Collaborations on projects</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Ideas like this are what we hope will drive our community to become greater and more benificial to all kinds of artists.</p>

					<p>PhyerNet is a subsidiary of Phyer. A small production company that focuses on many forms of entertainment. Ranging from comics &amp; games. And eventually animation &amp; music!</p>
					<p>Of course, something of this scope would indeed stir up an interest in starting up an online service &amp; art community! We always had the urge to do something grand for all fellow artists. That offered them a "platform" for displaying works and being able to meet up with each other. To teach, learn &amp; work together. In a more positive setting.</p>
					<p>Phyer &amp; PhyerNet are located in Hopkins, South Carolina. Right on the outskirts of the capitol city of "Columbia".</p>
					<h2>
						<span>-Mission Statement-</span>
					</h2>
					<p>PhyerNet's mission is to offer a "central point" to artists of varying skill types and talents that grants them a means to showcase and market their work. Plus, an interactive environment to help locate others that share the same ideas. To possibly teach or learn new skills from each other or to strike up collaborations.</p>
					<p>To fulfill our mission, we offer our users an assortment of powerful, yet friendly  "tools" that can help assist them towards meeting their goals. These tools grant them a means to display works &amp; collaborate with other users. The tools in question consist of a web script called "EZ File Manager" and the XMPP based instant messenger service, "ROAR!".</p>
					<p>The file manager offers users the means to securely access their drive space. This tool is also our answer to a long running history of issues regarding the use of FTP. Users are now able to freely access accounts without the need of having any knowledge of FTP. Or worrying about other complicated matters. Such as configuring ports or having to hassle their ISP as to why FTP functions are blocked.</p>
					<p>ROAR! is our exclusive chat service that allows users to communicate with one another. This service is powered by the extremely versatile protocol, "XMPP"! More commonly known as, "Jabber". This service compared to other instant messengers grants users more security &amp; control over who can openly message them. Adding to a user's own sense of privacy. All users can either send out instant messages or enter or create chatrooms!</p>
					<p>Despite how impressive these tools may seem. They are no match for the most important tool that even we cant provide. The "users" themselves! PhyerNet thrives off the ideal of users helping each other. By working together users develop stronger networking skills.</p>
					<p>Afterall, "no man is an island unto himself".</p>
					<hr/>
					<p class="question">Q: Who exactly are you guys?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: To sum it up. We wanted a TRUE community that would thrive and Drive its ownself. Things like this happens by the will of the users. Therefore you have users that DONT contribute to the core of what the service stands for. The drive of the service fails.</p>
					<p class="question">Q: What kind of web scripts can I use? Why is there no database support?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: More or less you can use just about any type of script you like as long as YOU know how to set it up and use it. But, whatever you use. Be sure it does not require an external database.</p>
					<p class="answer">As for why we dont provide one. Well, 1 of the ideas was to keep this service as streamlined and simple as possible. And you will be pretty shocked to see a wide array of very simple scripts out there that dont need databases. Therefore less pain, hassles and headaches for you AND us!</p>
					<p class="question">Q: So, just WHAT do you guy define as a "creative mind"?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: Individuals that are into a creative craft of some sort. These "crafts" can either be in a traditional or digital form and are placed into 4 distinct categories:
					</p>
					<ul class="plain answer">
						<li>Visual Mind: Covers graphic arts such as illustration, painting, sculpting, 3D modeling, human modeling, acting &amp; photography</li>
						<li>Sound Mind: Applies to instrumental or vocal music compositions, music production, spoken word or comedy &amp; sound creation</li>
						<li>Literary Mind: Covers areas of creative story &amp; script writing, screenplays and poems</li>
						<li>Logical Mind: Is a term that applies to the creative aspects of a more "technical" nature. Like, application programming, &amp; HTML development(Yes, we deemthings of this nature as "creative")</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">Q: So, okay. Im NOT a "creative mind". Is'nt there ANY service you guys can provide for me?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: Nope. Sorry. All roads closed...hmm, uh wait. Actually non-CM's can at least get a "file storage" type of account. Unfortunately it doesn't come with access to the chat. Plus the directory can't be accessed from the web.</p>
					<p class="question">Q: So who's driving this train?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: Pretty much you're looking at a service created, maintained and ordained by creative folks FOR creative folks...For us by us! Oh wait. Thats already claimed(runs off before the copyright police rolls through*)</p>
					<p class="question">Q: You guys talk big about a "community"! But wheres the "watches", "fav's" "friends lists" &amp; "commenting"? HMM?!</p>
					<p class="answer">A: Well, do ya really feel you need them? Its always good to know that other folks dig your stuff. And we agree with that 100%. But, on the other side of the coin. We feel things like this is not what we should rely on to drive ourselves to become better. Or determine who we decide to interact with.</p>
					<p class="answer">What we did was essentially give you guys a blank foundation to build yourselves on. All the way down to how you want your site itself to represent you. Everyone here is on level ground. No numbers. No Stats. No "superstars". Just you and the rest of the community.</p>
