Q: So, just WHAT do you guy define as a "creative mind"?

   it doesn't come with access to the chat. Plus the directory cant
   be accessed from the web.

<TERMS of SERVICE>
Only one "PHREE pass" account allowed per user. Customers caught opening up or owning additional free accounts under various user profiles will be banned. And their accounts will be suspended until further notice. This also includes anyone caught "assisting" others by "piggybacking". Allowing the use of their art or name to open an account. "Piggybacking" is a term that we use to describe 2 scenarios. The first as described in the previous line as an artist that is or is not registered to PhyerNet allowing another person to use their works and name in some cases. As a means to "validate" their claim of being someone or something they are not. The other form of piggybacking is users that willingly allow non-users to use their login info to access the services. This sort of activity is strongly discouraged. As it can lead to accounts being compromised if the person the login info was entrusted to "shares" it with others. Plus this can lead to random logins to ROAR!. Which can possibly lead up to problems for other users. 

It is encouraged that users DO NOT share login info! We reserve the right to deactivate any accounts we feel are suspected of "piggybacking". 

"PHREE pass" accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are subject to deactivation & deletion. The owners will receive notice before & after the accounts are removed. Users that lose their accounts due to inactivity must re-submit their information to reestablish service.

Customers can still use the ROAR! chat services for another 24 hours after the web account is deactivated. This is given as a "courtesy" to allow the customer a chance to update their contacts on their situation or try and reach the System Administrator to make arrangements for payment. If a customer is unable to render any payments or make an arrangement for payment for whatever reason. The account will be deactivated until payment is made. Customers have 30 additional days from the account's deactivation to render full payment to reactivate services. Or the account will be permanently closed. Any returning customers that try to open a new account and was delinquent with a previous one are expected to pay off the pending debt before any new orders can be processed.

<CANCELATION POLICY>
A user that desires to cancel service can do so at anytime by contacting the System Administrator. Once contacted the system admin will begin a "break down" process that entails fully removing the user's web access account and then their ROAR login. This process takes under 24 hours and the user need not check in to insure the process was completed. It is strongly cautioned that before submitting such an order that the user takes the appropriate time & measures to notify their ROAR! contacts and backup any content they desire to keep. For once an account is removed. All files & settings are gone. If the user wishes to use PhyerNet again. He/she will need to resubmit their info again to reestablish service.
___________________________________________________________________
<MONEY BACK>
We do not offer any "money back guarantees" past the 1st 30 days. "Money back" options are only valid to users that left during the 1st 30 days of service. Due to being dissatisfied for any reason with the service. However if the user was removed from the service due to misconduct or a breach in the terms of service. Any claims for "money back" will be revoked.
