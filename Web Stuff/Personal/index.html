			<h1>Browser Information</h1>
			<p>In the world of web design, it has been a tradition to be difficult to provide a similar user interface across multiple browsers, especially of different brands. However with the advent of web standards, it makes sense to follow those, as the web continues forward. As such I make no guarantee that my work will work exactly the same on old browsers. Old browsers include, but are not limited to Internet Explore 6.0 and older, Firefox 1.5 and older, Opera 8 and older, and Netscape Navigator (any version).</p>
			<p>These browsers do not support web standards, and so I can make no guarantee that my work will function or look the same in these or similar browsers. As such I advise you and all of your patrons and customers to upgrade to a browser that does support web standards. This is part of a global movement to standardize the web and provide accessibility features that everyone can be happy about. To learn more about the web standards movement, please follow this <a id="webStandardsProjectLink" href="http://www.webstandards.org/">link</a> to The Web Standards Project.</p>
			<p>Thanks.</p>

					<p>This is a blog of current improvements being made to our site. I will provide some information here pertaining to both my work and the site as a whole. The <a href="https://www.phyer.net/cgi-bin/fmanager/index.cgi?act=message_form&user=nathanlane&subject=helpdesk&content=Put%20your%20question%20here.">helpdesk</a> link above links to an internal application currently. So if you are not logged in, then you will first be taken to the login page, which should redirect to the helpdesk entry form. Please only use this form when you absolutely cannot resolve your problem or situation yourself. But also know that we will attempt to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.</p>
