This text file serves only as a "run down" list of a few core ideas
and concepts for the hardware codenamed "Project G". This document
will be continuosly actively updated with purely "fantasy" concepts
until they can be proven "possible". Such concepts that make it to
the point in which they can be classified as "solid" will be listed
in the actual design document.

Project G, is a only code name that will be used publicly to refer
to the gaming platform called "Gaia". Until further notice. Project
G is the only name that will be allowed to refer to the hardware in
public. And any/all concepts & ideas listed on this file must never
be mentioned publicly.

CONCEPT 1:

Small Form factor-
One major concept that has been planned for Project G. Was the use
of smaller chipsets and alot of integrated technologies to allow us
the ability to build the system with a small foot print. One system
that comes to mind for an example is, "Zonbu". A miniPC/ITX system
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonbu) with a minimal linux Operating
system.

At the rate technology is progressing, in terms of power and size.
It is very possible to integrate everything needed by the system to
1 system board. The power supply itself can also be placed outside 
the case. As a "powerbrick". As seen with other small systems. Such
as laptops or external USB devices.

Despite the smaller size. The ability to keep the system cool even
during long running sessions of heavy usage. Should be possible to
pull off. As the power supply is out of the system. There should be
absolutely no moving parts. Like a disk rom or hard drive. And the
circutry should be smaller and drawing less current.

All this equals out to a smaller system that should run quietly and
is exempt to having any system failures. Due to overheating issues.

CONCEPT 2:

Compact Flash-
Regarding the media format for the actual games & internal storage.
It was discussed awhile back to consider using Compact Flash-like 
technology(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_flash). 

Regarding the actual cards the games would be on. We should figure
out a means to allow only the system to write to the media. Such as
to save a player's data or for udates & patches meant for the game
itself. Rather then using up the player's own system's drive space.

This would of course mean that the player cannot overwrite or erase
the card's actual content. And if possible. Prevent the player from
trying to access the card's contents via a standard PC card reader 
to copy and transfer the data to another CF card. Which would be a
pirating ploy.

Many benefits come from using CF cards over disk drives for loading
applications. As well as for storing data internally over standard
hard disks. These benefits are:
1- Less power consumption
2- Read & write speeds are sufficient enough to rival moving disks
3- Less power consumption & no moving parts reduces "overheating"
4- The hardware itself can be shipped in very small form factors
5- Durable and resitant to many forms of physical shock
6- Available in various starage capacities

Despite these positives points. There are a few drawbacks that must
be mentioned:

1- CF like any other flash type technology have a shorter lifespan
2- If power is lost during a write cycle. Data could be corrupted
3- Slightly lower read & write speeds compared to moving disks

The idea of using this format is that alot of developers. could cut
cost in production as the technology to write the applications to
the media are far cheaper than disk duplicators. Plus the developer
can use lower storage capacity cards as opposed to being tied down
to a size disk standard. Such as with DVD's & Blu Ray.

Due to the fact that CF cards & reader/writers are widely available
to the consummer. This opens up doorways for independant developers
to be able to create their own games and share them directly with a
friend.

CONCEPT 3:

Upgradability-
What has to be one of the most questionable ideas aside from the us
even considering developing a console. Is, "the concept of making G
"modular"". By "modular", we are talking about the possibilities of
an actual upgradable & easy to modify system at the user's level.

The idea came about during discussions over the escalating costs of
research & development firms. Each time an older system's lifecycle
comes to an end. They overhaul the entire units as 1 as opposed to
focusing on just what really could use the upgrade. And leaving the
things that do work and could hold the system over for a few more 
cycles.

This could help cut down development costs. Give th

Modules/Items the user can upgrade at their level:
1-DDR Ram
2- System board+CPU
3- CF Reader/Writer
4- Internal Storage
5- Chassis & Fans
6- Power Supply

Items the user can upgrade but is not supported unless serviced by
actual techs we certify:

1- Swapping system board CPU's
2- Adding in cooling devices
3- Gamepad modifications
4- Full chassis modifications
5- Overclocking items tied to the systemboard

Items the user can upgrade but is not supported by us(3rd Party):

1- USB devices aside from ones developed by us or an affiliate
2- CF media or reader/writers not certified & tested by us
3- Power Supply modifications
4- Overclocking items by a non-certified individual
5- Ram not certified & tested by us

Using this approach could really cut down on unnecesarry R&D fees &
allow the user more control and power over when its time to upgrade
the system. Its not a 100% truly effective plan that wont come with
out a few problems. Or cause a few users to feel "intimedated". But
the possibility that the consumer can be won over by realizing the
power he/she weilds over their gaming is high. Plus, the "average
gamer" this day & age has evolved a great deal as opposed to 5yrs 
ago whereas the idea of such a system really would scare the user
off. 

As the mentality back in those times was, "I only care to turn the
system on then off when done". This straight forward frame of mind
has been changed considerable thanks to importers. Users desiring a
chance to play games that were not compatible with their system was
forced to dive into the seedy world of "unsupported modding". Some
with success. Most with a faulty system that could not be repaired
under the manufacturer's warranties.

So, with these factors in mind. It is indeed time for the console
market to concider this approach. As the consummer IS "ready". If
the user can stand for risking to break a system due to chip mods.
The user is deffinitely ready to try this. With the added bonus of
there being a bit of support from manufacturers.

CONCEPT 4:

OS vs. Firmware-
This brings about another internal debate with those aware of the
plans for Project G. Whether or not, to go with using firmware as
other integrated systems do. Or, to consider the combination of 2
worlds. Using an actual operating system for the user. And firmware
for the system itself. 

The idea was to offer an OS that worked only on the Gaia hardware 
platform that gave the user an interface for them to interact with 
their games, other possible applications and painlessly upgrade or 
apply patches without risking any harm to the firmware. Firmware 
would be hard coded to the systemboards. The only real function it 
serves is to identify with the OS that it is indeed a Gaia system &
communicate at the "system level" to fulfill the user's needs.

There should be absolutely no reason for firmware to be patched. Or
in this case "flashed". Which can risk the user having an unusable
system. As with the case with most PC systems. Whereas a user would
flash the motherboard's bios. And either have resolved their issues
or created alot more. These risks are too high. Even in the case of
the user taking the item in question to a certified tech to perform
there may be complications. Which are things we may not be able to 
fully support.

CONCEPT 6:

Multi-tasking-
It should be understood that desdpite the fact of wanting to use an
actual OS in an upgradable system. We are not out to "recreate the 
PC". What we are simply doing is bringing in not just a "new gaming
platform". We are trying to do just what should have been held to
other companies before. "Making an actual usable entertainment hub"
for the average person.

Although the Gaia is not a "true" PC platform. There is still a few
benefits of introducing a few PC-like elements and applications to
the user:

1- Ability to pause, minumize & swap one active session for another
2- Ability to playback various media formats that are supported
3- Customizable interface that is an ease to swap out with themes
4- Support for multiple sessions. More than 1 application running
