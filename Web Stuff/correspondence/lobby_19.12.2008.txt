(5:44:39 PM) Lynx Foxx: Well everyone in here knows me (because im a bit too talkative), but just to clarify I'm an artist, who willingly does graphics, a small musician thats trying to obtain more knowledge in music, and a programmer who has lost too much memory from years of leaving it lie.

(5:54:12 PM) Phyeraboss: ...those are not vitamins pete
(5:54:27 PM) Phyeraboss: viagra does'nt work that way

(5:54:55 PM) Phyeraboss: no
(5:55:05 PM) Galion: :D
(5:55:36 PM) sanny: that made me think of a disturbing iamge
(5:55:49 PM) Galion: it's cold in here too.. hang on a sec
(5:55:56 PM) sanny: medecine that cause seizure and then viagra the girl ill be overwelmingly happy
(5:56:35 PM) Flack the Jack left the room.
(5:57:14 PM) Galion: Aah nice and warm :)
(5:57:30 PM) Flack the Jack [flackthejack@phyer.net/Domain-of-the-Forsaken] entered the room.
(5:57:44 PM) Phyeraboss: wb
(5:58:10 PM) Phyeraboss: ok, its almost 8 and I know nate has to leave in a bit
(5:58:21 PM) Phyeraboss: so i'll relay this bit of info
(5:58:28 PM) Phyeraboss: as it pertains to the PTG
(5:58:32 PM) Phyeraboss: before he takes off
(5:59:13 PM) Phyeraboss: as most of you have seen so far and from the links nate just posted
(5:59:21 PM) Phyeraboss: theres ALOT of big changes coming up
(5:59:26 PM) Phyeraboss: for PhyerNet
(5:59:49 PM) Phyeraboss: and just to warn ya. They will be come pretty hard & fast
(6:00:00 PM) Phyeraboss: since kyle & nate dont waste time^^
(6:00:19 PM) Phyeraboss: for now Iwe cant relay EVERYTHING thats going to change
(6:00:20 PM) sanny: hehe
(6:00:47 PM) Phyeraboss: but the biggest change I will need to announce to you guys and I wanted EVERYONE in here to get
(6:00:51 PM) sanny: well bette rthen seom sites that says they ae gonan fix soem erros... but never does exepot chagne interface and so on but dosent fix the massive bugs
(6:01:12 PM) Phyeraboss: was that darkopollis.com will be closing
(6:01:25 PM) sanny: oh
(6:01:27 PM) Phyeraboss: so all of you over there will be merged under phyer.net
(6:01:34 PM) Phyeraboss: as it was originally planned
(6:01:40 PM) sanny: ok
(6:01:52 PM) Phyeraboss: so this also means I'll need to revise a few policies
(6:02:16 PM) Phyeraboss: so anyone with an index will have  to put up some sort of an html face
(6:02:25 PM) Phyeraboss: that includes a disclaimer
(6:02:38 PM) Phyeraboss: as those of you who were over there were adult artists
(6:03:03 PM) sanny: shuld put upp one that is jstu say "arive soon"
(6:03:43 PM) Flack the Jack left the room.
(6:04:28 PM) Phyeraboss: originally the reason I separated all of you was to avoid any unnecessary drama over peoplr griping about coming across adult art or musicians with explicit lyrics
(6:04:40 PM) Flack the Jack [flackthejack@phyer.net/Domain-of-the-Forsaken] entered the room.
(6:04:56 PM) Phyeraboss: but after alot of thought
(6:05:08 PM) Phyeraboss: i decided that it was actually pointless
(6:05:13 PM) Phyeraboss: and a waste of resources
(6:05:24 PM) Phyeraboss: ...plus it'll be less headaches for the PTG
(6:05:27 PM) Phyeraboss: heheh
(6:05:38 PM) CM August: How about those who know jack about html?
(6:05:50 PM) CM August: Assuming we're responsible for our own pages.
(6:06:01 PM) sanny: im having basic knowledge but never gets my ass to do it
(6:06:30 PM) Phyeraboss: well, thats another task of the ptg
(6:07:05 PM) Phyeraboss: we can provide a simple front page 
(6:07:16 PM) Phyeraboss: that can be uploaded
(6:07:28 PM) Phyeraboss: thing is, it'll be a pretty "general" page
(6:07:37 PM) Phyeraboss: so nothing special will be in it
(6:08:01 PM) Phyeraboss: by nature no one would be able to find your area
(6:08:13 PM) Phyeraboss: unless you gave them the url
(6:08:23 PM) Phyeraboss: or they stumbled across it
(6:09:21 PM) Phyeraboss: so to protect your own rears
(6:09:33 PM) Phyeraboss: thats the measure we'll need to face
(6:09:36 PM) nathanlane: Perhaps in the future we could provide some tools to help with page creation.
(6:10:01 PM) Phyeraboss: yeah, thats what I was thinking too
(6:10:18 PM) Phyeraboss: technically the filemanager can let you guys create pages
(6:10:25 PM) Phyeraboss: even a basic page
(6:10:35 PM) Phyeraboss: which is covered in the tutorial.txt
(6:11:45 PM) sanny: thot maybe ahv esoem blog allso?
(6:11:51 PM) sanny: or is it to complex?
(6:12:10 PM) Phyeraboss: you guys are free to do your sites any which waty you like
(6:12:38 PM) Phyeraboss: plus the PTG will also provide a service to help with site creation in the future
(6:12:49 PM) Phyeraboss: but i will be honest
(6:12:54 PM) Phyeraboss: it wont be free=\
(6:12:58 PM) sanny: nods
(6:13:05 PM) Phyeraboss: or expensive
(6:13:16 PM) sanny: maybe to get around that perhaps ahve soem adds in a corner
(6:14:14 PM) Phyeraboss: well, im still revising the service terms a bit
(6:14:26 PM) Phyeraboss: but as i said you guys are free to do as you please
(6:14:32 PM) Phyeraboss: even run google apps
(6:14:42 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yeah sorry about being gone, went to eat
(6:14:43 PM) sanny: ok
(6:14:44 PM) Phyeraboss: only under the condition that anything you run
(6:14:53 PM) Flack the Jack: Will our darkopollis sites be moved to phyer? Or will we have to redo everything?
(6:14:54 PM) Phyeraboss: YOU are responsible for
(6:14:57 PM) Phyeraboss: bot us
(6:15:01 PM) Lynx Foxx: but I dont know who has been getting the idea that the pages are HIDDEN
(6:15:06 PM) Phyeraboss: they will be moved
(6:15:09 PM) Lynx Foxx: theyre only hidden, ect if you MAKE them that way
(6:15:22 PM) Phyeraboss: yeah we're getting there k
(6:15:28 PM) Lynx Foxx: Ok.
(6:15:51 PM) Phyeraboss: but anyways as long as what you do/run on your site is NOT resource intensive on the rest of the service or users
(6:16:02 PM) Phyeraboss: cause any sort of "security issues"
(6:16:10 PM) sanny: maybe have it as art storage on my part
(6:16:18 PM) Phyeraboss: or is just not compatible
(6:16:24 PM) Phyeraboss: woth our setup
(6:16:27 PM) Phyeraboss: with*
(6:16:53 PM) Phyeraboss: you can run & setup your site any way you like
(6:17:05 PM) Phyeraboss: hey nate, anything to add?
(6:17:20 PM) Phyeraboss: to what I was saying*
(6:18:03 PM) nathanlane: looks like you just create index.html and put it in the root of your directory, unless you want people browsing your work
(6:18:25 PM) nathanlane: Same for every directory -- the default is that anybody can see your directory contents
(6:18:39 PM) nathanlane: ...if they know your phyernet address
(6:18:47 PM) Schwert [schwert@phyer.net/hrogndzelns-computer] entered the room.
(6:18:57 PM) Schwert: Hey, what's this all going on
(6:19:06 PM) Lynx Foxx: Hey Schwert.
(6:19:23 PM) Lynx Foxx: We are having a 'meet'
(6:19:33 PM) Phyeraboss: oh, real quick on that note: the function to Password protect dirs is down
(6:19:38 PM) nathanlane: A very fast example (I didn't have anything before) is http://www.phyer.com/nathanlane/
(6:19:41 PM) Phyeraboss: we are currently looking into it
(6:20:16 PM) Phyeraboss: BUT, if you guys need a quick option, I can set up a password setup on the server side
(6:20:19 PM) Schwert: Ah, I see haha
(6:20:28 PM) Phyeraboss: and yes, look at nate's example
(6:20:40 PM) Phyeraboss: of how easy you can setup a quick page
(6:20:54 PM) Flack the Jack left the room.
(6:20:59 PM) nathanlane: You could also go to http://www.phyer.com/nathanlane/index.html (it's the same page)
(6:21:13 PM) Lynx Foxx: From that point on, you are free to edit it as you like.
(6:21:43 PM) Lynx Foxx: Within Perl/RoR/Java/and HTML's limits, of course.
(6:21:48 PM) nathanlane: Yeah -- feel free to copy that page into your own directory and edit it in between the <body> or the next <div id="pageWrapper"> tag
(6:21:49 PM) Flack the Jack [flackthejack@phyer.net/Domain-of-the-Forsaken] entered the room.

(6:41:18 PM) Schwert: I wish I could afford a moog voyager
(6:41:32 PM) shaw left the room.

(6:41:54 PM) Galion: That sucks
(6:42:06 PM) Galion: That's why I really like Virus TI
(6:42:07 PM) Schwert: I have a moogerfooger MF-102 though, which is amazing and fun 
(6:42:15 PM) Schwert: Yeah the TI is probably the new standard of digital synths
(6:42:18 PM) Galion: You can do almost anything with that
(6:42:32 PM) Galion: But at the moment I use Nexus 2
(6:42:33 PM) Schwert: My favorite synth really though is the Korg MS20
(6:42:37 PM) Galion: VSTi
(6:42:53 PM) Schwert: I have a friend who has an ms20, I have like the modern version of it, which is the MS2000B
(6:43:03 PM) Schwert: An analog modeling synth, but it sounds pretty true to the original
(6:43:11 PM) Schwert: but it also has polyphony and some other nicknacks
(6:43:13 PM) Galion: Nice :)
(6:43:35 PM) Schwert: Last band I was in we used it to make sequences, that I'd drum to
(6:43:40 PM) Galion: My budy that I make most of my music with likes the analog synths the most *hehe* 
(6:44:15 PM) Galion: He can sit for hours just tweaking the sounds to perfection :P
(6:44:19 PM) Flack the Jack left the room.
(6:44:24 PM) shaw [shaw@phyer.net/Meebo] entered the room.
(6:44:45 PM) Schwert: Yeah haha
(6:44:50 PM) Schwert: I can relate to that
(6:44:58 PM) Galion: btw at the moment I'm siting here making a DnB track.. DreaMSectioN style :D
(6:44:59 PM) Phyeraboss: well, lemme catch those of you that just came in up on the recent topics...(bitten, schwert & shaw*)
(6:45:03 PM) Schwert: I'm a fuckin' nerd when it comes to synths
(6:45:05 PM) Schwert: Mmmkay
(6:45:13 PM) Flack the Jack [flackthejack@phyer.net/Domain-of-the-Forsaken] entered the room.
(6:45:16 PM) Phyeraboss: musicians feel free to use the PM feature
(6:45:25 PM) Phyeraboss: heh
(6:45:27 PM) Phyeraboss: wb
(6:45:50 PM) shaw: Just sum it up quickly, I can imagine it being bothersome otherwise to start over repatedly :B
(6:45:54 PM) Phyeraboss: ok, 1st hand the big newss is that those of you on darkopollis will be moved under phyer.net
(6:46:24 PM) Phyeraboss: as I pointed out earlier to the others, and as some of you may have noticed
(6:46:34 PM) Phyeraboss: theres ALOT of big changes taking place
(6:46:40 PM) Phyeraboss: and many more to come
(6:46:53 PM) Phyeraboss: I cant tell you everything...not yet;)
(6:46:58 PM) shaw: Sounds cool B)
(6:47:00 PM) Phyeraboss: but you'll love it
(6:47:23 PM) Flack the Jack: We get a high quaty flash game that lets us raep Nintendo babes
(6:47:47 PM) Phyeraboss: Nathanlane & lynx are the active members of what will be known as the PTG= phyernet task group
(6:48:05 PM) Phyeraboss: they're job is to help service and maintain phyernet
(6:48:10 PM) Phyeraboss: on the web side
(6:48:29 PM) Phyeraboss: as well as develop new tools and support current ones
(6:48:48 PM) Phyeraboss: bitten, remember that little issue you was having with your gallery?
(6:49:08 PM) Phyeraboss: these are the guys to ask about that...as well as me^^
(6:50:00 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yep.
(6:50:31 PM) Phyeraboss: on that note, a few more services changes I brought up will be that those of you that were on darkopollis with adult content will need to throw up an actual index html page
(6:50:42 PM) Phyeraboss: complete with some sort of disclaimer
(6:51:00 PM) Phyeraboss: now that you will be sharing bunks with the general audience crowd
(6:51:44 PM) Phyeraboss: its not quite like anyone can just see what you have unless they actually have your url
(6:52:03 PM) Phyeraboss: so thats why its safe to get that stuff up in the near future
(6:52:09 PM) Phyeraboss: to covver your flanks
(6:52:10 PM) shaw: so darkopollis users are switched to phyer, and phyer allows for such content now as long as it has a disclaimer?
(6:52:14 PM) Phyeraboss: cover*
(6:52:21 PM) Phyeraboss: yep
(6:52:56 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yes, that the user is about to see something of a different nature. If a user has clean artwork solely, its not needed, but for those going to have adult artwork, its advisable you do create a disclaimer.
(6:53:14 PM) Lynx Foxx: A simple sentence or phrase such as "Warning" is a disclaimer.
(6:54:01 PM) Phyeraboss: originally this was my plan 
(6:54:29 PM) Phyeraboss: but due to all the gripping i seen on DA & FA over "Uhg I see breast in my inbox"
(6:54:46 PM) Phyeraboss: I thought it was a good idea to keep the 2 audiences separated
(6:55:02 PM) Phyeraboss: but in truth it was kind of a waste
(6:55:14 PM) Phyeraboss: as no one really would have inboxes
(6:55:31 PM) nathanlane: Everyone, I have provided a very simple HTML template file for you all to use as your default HTML file. Please this in you main directory, and you can edit it however you want (just put your content under <body> and before </body>). It is located here: http://www.phyer.com/nathanlane/_examples/
(6:55:39 PM) Phyeraboss: pretty much if YOU stumble into a gallery thats under a disclaimer
(6:55:53 PM) Phyeraboss: you did that at YOUR OWN WILL
(6:55:56 PM) nathanlane: or http://www.phyer.com/nathanlane/_examples/index.html
(6:56:08 PM) Phyeraboss: so that protects you
(6:56:11 PM) nathanlane: (same file really)
(6:56:11 PM) Phyeraboss: ...and us>.>
(6:57:57 PM) Phyeraboss: afterall, both sides of the fence CAN co-exist
(6:58:10 PM) shaw left the room.
(6:59:03 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo [shaw@phyer.net/Meebo] entered the room.
(6:59:48 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: That HTML template, is there any special coding in it that's needed, or just a template for peeps who doesn't have a index page or such already?
(7:00:34 PM) Phyeraboss: no
(7:00:38 PM) nathanlane: It's overly simple -- there is virtually no HTML coding in it right now
(7:00:50 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yeah, a simple line.
(7:00:54 PM) Phyeraboss: matter of fact its outlined in the tutorial.txt in each of your accounts
(7:01:14 PM) Phyeraboss: you can simply just "create a file"
(7:01:20 PM) Phyeraboss: name it index.txt
(7:01:27 PM) Lynx Foxx: index.html*
(7:01:35 PM) Phyeraboss: and that
(7:01:41 PM) Phyeraboss: when your done 
(7:01:49 PM) Phyeraboss: but yeah, index.html^^
(7:02:11 PM) nathanlane: Naming it index.txt just means that it won't render as HTML -- so don't include HTML tags if you do it that way
(7:02:52 PM) Lynx Foxx: ah the beauty of flat file
(7:03:38 PM) Phyeraboss: see why I got them?
(7:03:46 PM) Phyeraboss: they saved my ass right there
(7:03:52 PM) Phyeraboss: heheh
(7:04:50 PM) nathanlane: I don't want to send you somewhere that isn't here, but if you want to make some HTML and don't know how, then I can suggest using WebMonkey (http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/Make_an_HTML_Document). It is a very simple beginners and advanced users site for anything web-based. This particular page teaches some HTML basics.
(7:05:22 PM) Lynx Foxx: http://www.w3schools.com/
(7:05:28 PM) Lynx Foxx: Another good one.
(7:05:35 PM) nathanlane: I second that
(7:05:42 PM) Lynx Foxx: it'd be better to go to the former first then the latter.
(7:05:48 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo left the room.
(7:06:45 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo [shaw@phyer.net/Meebo] entered the room.
(7:06:55 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: Webdesigning can be fun once you actually get the hang of it, lol :I
(7:07:02 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yes.
(7:07:09 PM) Phyeraboss: ...why the doubtful face then
(7:07:10 PM) Lynx Foxx: The same goes with any programming language.
(7:07:12 PM) Phyeraboss: ?
(7:07:19 PM) Phyeraboss: heheh
(7:07:50 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: fun, but annoying too~
(7:08:34 PM) Lynx Foxx: When using any programming language, at first glance its always a conundrum. When you understand and get the hang of it more, possibilities arrive, annoyance also, but when you get past the frivolity of it, it's something new each time.
(7:09:03 PM) Lynx Foxx: Because sometimes script can be fickle.
(7:09:05 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: Yeah
(7:09:05 PM) Lynx Foxx: Yet.
(7:09:22 PM) Lynx Foxx: A simple tweak in the right direction can make it all work together, I know this as a FACT.
(7:13:04 PM) Phyeraboss: ok now anybody has a few questions or ideas they wish to toss out there?
(7:13:20 PM) Phyeraboss: you got me & the service staff here
(7:13:25 PM) Phyeraboss: nows the time;)
(7:14:35 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: free cupcake fridays
(7:14:48 PM) Phyeraboss: ...for the last time shae
(7:14:52 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: seems like a very good idea to me
(7:14:52 PM) Phyeraboss: shaw*
(7:14:54 PM) Phyeraboss: NO
(7:14:56 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: :C
(7:16:00 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo: Then I got nothing.
(7:16:59 PM) Phyeraboss: heh, well its not much but just from this session you guys got the rough of what i built this service for...and wit these guys help, we are looking to spearhead this into a thriving community
(7:17:03 PM) Phyeraboss: when things pick up
(7:17:11 PM) Phyeraboss: you all, just be sitting in here
(7:17:18 PM) Phyeraboss: met new faces
(7:17:28 PM) Phyeraboss: and picked up on a few new ideas
(7:17:33 PM) Phyeraboss: and ways of doing things
(7:17:40 PM) Phyeraboss: ...not much
(7:17:44 PM) Phyeraboss: but just enough
(7:18:10 PM) Phyeraboss: in the future we will try to hold more service meetings
(7:18:20 PM) omnicide: This is another reason we try to encourage people to come in to the service early.
(7:18:41 PM) Phyeraboss: and if nate or kyle or up to it...maybe a "class" or something?
(7:18:48 PM) Phyeraboss: on html basics
(7:18:55 PM) Lynx Foxx: Sure thing.
(7:19:10 PM) Lynx Foxx: Getting into HTML by yourself for beginners can be a daunting task.
(7:19:23 PM) Lynx Foxx: but with a bit of clarification its simple.
(7:20:35 PM) Phyeraboss: also, another idea I been bouncing around is to host special "themed weeks"
(7:21:04 PM) Phyeraboss: like every month, the last week of that month will have a special theme
(7:21:40 PM) Phyeraboss: its not mandatory but just an open free for all to apply your trades in a way that meets the theme
(7:21:52 PM) Phyeraboss: like 1 idea me and VD had...
(7:21:56 PM) Phyeraboss: "Comedy week"
(7:22:00 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo left the room.
(7:22:30 PM) Phyeraboss: 1 week of basically trying to use your skills to make folks laugh
(7:22:49 PM) Phyeraboss: and of course these can be looked at as challenges/contests
(7:23:15 PM) Phyeraboss: as I know that should be up most of you guy's alleys 
(7:23:23 PM) Phyeraboss: seeing as you're all clown
(7:23:29 PM) ***Phyeraboss looks at flack
(7:23:43 PM) Phyeraboss: heheh
(7:23:57 PM) Phyeraboss: but anyone else have something to ask or add?
(7:24:10 PM) Phyeraboss: seriously: DONT BE SHY
(7:24:21 PM) Phyeraboss: these meets are the last place to feel intimidated in
(7:25:02 PM) shaw@phyer.net/Meebo [shaw@phyer.net/Meebo] entered the room.
(7:26:10 PM) omnicide: Hint...meet.
(7:26:14 PM) omnicide: We're all friendly here.
(7:26:16 PM) Flack the Jack: HA! lies
(7:26:18 PM) Schwert left the room.
(7:26:31 PM) Flack the Jack: A room full of naked women with DDs is the last room to feel intimidaded in
(7:26:44 PM) Phyeraboss: unless your "funny"
(7:26:49 PM) Phyeraboss: like a fruit roll-up
(7:27:07 PM) Flack the Jack: Nah, if you were gay you could just talk about girly shit
(7:27:09 PM) Flack the Jack: Gab
(7:27:14 PM) Flack the Jack: Gay.chcik stuff
(7:27:20 PM) Flack the Jack: gay/chick
(7:27:22 PM) Phyeraboss: ...wheres the fun in that?
(7:27:25 PM) Lynx Foxx: Better yet, wear ANY shirt. put it in a knot on your chest.
(7:27:27 PM) Lynx Foxx: Voila
(7:27:32 PM) Lynx Foxx: :x
(7:27:33 PM) Phyeraboss: hahaha
(7:27:34 PM) Flack the Jack: Now you know why I'm not gay Boss
(7:27:42 PM) Phyeraboss: master of disguise
(7:28:44 PM) Lynx Foxx: If I ever see someone do that, then go like "do you know who I am?" -pulls cape from nowhere- IM THE GODDAMN BATMAN.
(7:29:04 PM) Lynx Foxx: wonder: how the hell did he do that.
(7:29:24 PM) CautionCat [cautioncat@phyer.net/Anus] entered the room.

(7:50:00 PM) Lynx Foxx: also, we've discussed that the merging of darkopollis and phyer
(7:50:23 PM) opius: i thought they were the same oo;;
(7:50:25 PM) Lynx Foxx: rendering darkopollis gone, and all artist on there will need a disclaimer for their explicit art they post.
(7:50:31 PM) Flack the Jack: http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/89349
(7:50:32 PM) Lynx Foxx: oh no, they were meant to separate.
(7:50:36 PM) QT Melon: lol

(7:50:45 PM) opius: no skitty nooo! ;3;

(7:50:57 PM) QT Melon: well I barely use the web services to be honest since I run my own site
(7:51:07 PM) Flack the Jack: Oh
(7:51:11 PM) Phyeraboss: and during service meets
(7:51:16 PM) Lynx Foxx: True, but even through that; It has to be said
(7:51:19 PM) Lynx Foxx: just to update you 
(7:51:31 PM) Phyeraboss: remember some folks in here might NOT be into that stuff
(7:51:36 PM) Lynx Foxx: exactly

(7:53:09 PM) QT Melon: I can lend my services from time to time if you need help, but I don't think you do - I've done webmastering in the past
(7:53:14 PM) Lynx Foxx: anyway: so if indeed you DO use the service, though you have the website on studiokemono, if you use phyer, and post explicit art on it, make sire you put a disclaimer
(7:53:53 PM) QT Melon: hence why I run my own site right now X3
(7:54:10 PM) Lynx Foxx: and for an odd reason people have not understood that the service is actually NOT apart of a template, as in FA or DA; adhering to how they set it up, the tables and such for each user
(7:54:20 PM) nathanlane: Well, it was nice to meet you all. As said I will be available on the PTG as software tech support, etc. The details are still coming through the pipe. I need to take off, so I will see you all another time. Thanks
