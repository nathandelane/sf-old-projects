<font size="3">The year is 2110AD. Man has finally began his trek towards the planets of our solar system. Despite such a huge leap. He still has yet to fully explore the remaining 87% of his own world. Thanks to the many advances in enviornmental technology and nano research. Man may finally be on the brink of uncovering the most elussive mysteries his world has hidden away.</font><br>
<font size="3">...including those that were meant to stay hidden.</font><br>
<font size="3">&quot;Black Ice&quot; is the project name given to an expedition founded by the Eicherman corporation &amp; Solomon Tech University. The mission was to explore deep beneath the Earth's polar ice caps. Primarily targeting a vast area of what is claimed to be the impact zone of a huge astroid. The very one that may have been the cause of the dinosaurs extinction and the bringing of the ice age. The black ice group consisted of highly skilled scientists, engineers and physisists. The group was also escorted by a specially trained group for security detail.</font><br>
<font size="3">Recent data transmissions from the satallite link with the site shown that upon reaching a mark over 2 miles beneath the ice, the group made a strange discovery. They stumbled on to what appeared to be a vast network of caverns that contained thriving ecosystems. The creatures they found in these tunnels were unlike anything they have ever seen. 3 days later after these findings. Two 13 man teams were formed to split up and explore some of the caverns and start setting up away points till more personel were brought out to the site. 23 hours from the beginning of the expidition, black ice operations lost all contact with team 1. Fearing that the walls of the carverns were blocking the data transmissions. A few members of team 2 was ordered to try and track down team 1. Plus, set up data link points in hopes that it would help boost team 2's signal.</font><br>
<font size="3">Team 1 manages to established a few away points and built up a network of security perimeters a few days after team 1's disappearance. Further studies found that the lifeforms they encountered from the carverns was either a mutated form of a prehistoric earth species or a species that was completely alien. After a month 2 members of the missing team 1 expidition were found. They were both very shaken up. One member hardly spoke and the other could only say, &quot;what have we done? Why did we do it...?&quot;. Both of the men were covered in what appeared to be strange black roots. Upon examination of the data acquired from the missing team members enviro suit computers. Operations came across something that horrified them beyond reasoning. Before the order for a mass evacuation was made, all data transmissions and satillite feeds were cut. It was as if someone intended the group to never escape.</font><br>
<font size="3">...and warn the world.</font><br>
<font size="3">After 24 hours of the black ice inccident, &quot;HEART&quot; was contacted. &quot;HEART&quot;, the High-risk Emergency Assault &amp; Rescue Team. Is a group of highly skilled members that was started by a retired navy seal, &quot;Maj. Jonathan Harte&quot;. It was a group known for getting results fast and descretely. Which made them the idea choice for the mission to avoid bringing in the government. Since Mr. Harte's death, the team only consisted of Allisa Harte and her sister Cassandra. They inherited HEART from their father and vowed to keep the group going. Their father trained each of them in areas he felt they were best suited in. Allisa the oldest became an expert sharp-shooter and hand to hand combatant. While Cassandra was trained in the fields of advanced science and engineering. The relationship they have: &quot;Cassadra builds it and Allisa breaks it&quot;.</font><br>
<font size="3">At the time that Solomon Tech contacted HEART. The sisters were in the process of testing out a prototype nano suit. The suit itself made use of nanites. A form of microscopic robots and nano circutry to power up the suit's deffense and offense systems. Despite the suit being incomplete. Allisa jumps at the job offer against Cassandra's advice. To compensate for the suit's faults. Cassandra pours all her efforts in completing an onboard computer system calleded &quot;CADI&quot;. The Combat assistant &amp; Data Interface. With CADI, she would be able to send and recieve data from the suit itself. Plus thanks to the nanites, she can create upgrades in realtime to the suit via the data link. Providing Allisa keeps the suit intact and stays in the range of a data stream. The nano suit had only one weapon designed for it. However, that too was not complete. The &quot;MPFA(Multi-Purpose Fire Arm)&quot; is a shape-shifting rifle that makes use of the suit's nanites to convert it to a wide range of weapon modes suited for various situations.</font><br>
<font size="3">At its current state, the suit enhances the wearer's own strength and speed up to 3 times. But to get the most out of the suit's abilities, the player must be mindful at all times of the signal strength for the Data Link. For every inch of the map explored and every enemy and item encountered, the CADI observes and processes the data. Then uploads it to the remote central database where Cassandra analyzes it. She then uses the compiled data to write code that causes the suit's nanites to develop a wide range of useful abilites. Even power up existing abilities. Other uses for the data link allows Cassandra to see and hear what is going on around Allisa. There may be cases where Cassandra picks up on various things in the surrounding area before allisa does. Plus, Cassandra can remotely hack into any drones, terminals or other devices left behind by the black ice crew. There may also be cases where the data link will get interrupted. Cases like that, is where Allisa is on her own and any outside help from her sister is futile.</font><br>
<font size="3">Allisa's nano suit is the key to her survival for completing the mission. Everything from generating various forcefields to healing wounds and manufacturing ammunition. The suit has power requierments for everything. The player will have 2 meters of equal length at the upper left hand corner of the screen that they must keep an eye on. The top meter that is red and with a heart beside it, is Allisa's health. As long as there is a forcefield being generated around her. She wont take any direct damage that would deplete the health meter. In most cases there are attacks that would kill Allisa instantly. Whenever health is low, the only way the player can recover it is to allow the suit to heal Allisa's wounds. Therefore, they must have enough energy built up that she starts automatically recovering health. As long as there is any red in this meter, the player can continue. But once it is empty. The game is over.</font><br>
<font size="3">The 2nd meter below the health meter is the power meter. Compared to the health meter, it is blue and by default has a &quot;ring&quot; beside it. The ring represents the &quot;blast feild&quot;. Which is the normal level forcefield the nano suit generates. This emblem will switch out to other ones depending on the type of field the player needs to equip. Unlike the health meter, the power meter is always draining unless the player cuts off the forcefields and does not use any of the weapons. Everything from the suit's force fields to the weapons use this meter. As long as there is enough energy available the player can continue to use these abilities. But, once the energy is depleted, all of these devices shutdown till energy is regenerated. Health recovery is drained from this meter as well. So, as long as Allisa has 100% health, the suit will not automatically allocate any energy for replenishing health.</font><br>
<font size="3">Power will keep being lost as long as a field is active and even more each time Allisa is hit by an enemy. The more powerful the attack. The more power is lost. Even the different weapons have their own energy cost. The nano suit can recover energy on its own for as long as the player has no devices running &amp; the player has full health. There is a few items hidden in the game that can assist the player with managing energy. &quot;Power Cells&quot; help to store energy. Plus, there are items that can help speed up the regeneration of energy and another to cut the consumption of it in half. The player can even locate recharge points scattered throughout the game.</font><br>
<font size="3">The data streaming function is an automatic process that is based off the location, number of steps made in that location, info acquired and Allisa's present status. From this, Cassandra generates non-essential upgrades &amp; other options. Based off essential location and essential data is what makes cassandra send over essential upgrades. With the &quot;Option&quot; button, the player can press UP on the directional pad to manually initiate a data feed directly to Cassandra. Though the process is generally automatic. There will be cases in which the data link is interrupted due to the data stream's range being blocked or being too weak.</font><br>
<font size="3">The player must keep an eye on the data stream's signal strength. Which is indicated by a series of 4 cellphone like bars beside the health &amp; power meters. The strongest signal is represented by all 4 bars solid. It is here the data link is stable, fast and 2-way traffic is possible. A good signal is represented by 3 solid bars. 2-way traffic is still possible but slow. 2 solid bars allows only one way traffic from Casandra but extremely slow transmission speeds. One bar represents the weakest signal but allows cassandra to still send messages but not data for upgrades or hacking. No bars indicate there is no data link signal available. So all transmissions are nullified. In cases like this, the player must try to keep the bars as high as possible to send/receive useful data. There is an item that allows the player to see data streams on screen and pin point them on the map. Plus theres another item to boost signal strength up by 1.</font><br>
<font size="3">There are cases where the player may encounter obstacles that block or redirect data streams. With the &quot;data stream viewer&quot; upgrade the player may see the stream and enemies that hide in it. Invisible to other scans. They are harmless to Allisa but block the data stream. Other obstacles such as devices or drones left behind by the black ice group can jam or redirect the data stream signal. Also, certain areas are totally void of the signal. Cases like this, the player can try to discover ways to direct the stream in these areas. But, there are some areas that the signal cannot reach. Most cases, would be &quot;alpha&quot; rooms. As these bosses are meant to be fought by the player without any assistance.</font><br>
<font size="3">Times when Cassandra is in the process of analyzing data sent to her. Small text flashes under the health &amp; power meter. Whenever theres a data link signal, the text fluctuates between recieving, analyzing, and sending. Whenever there is no signal, the text displays &quot;pending&quot;. Sending means that there is a connection and currently the CADI is uploading data to Cassandra's database</font><br>

<font color="#cc0000"><font size="2">(12:47:11 PM) </font><b><font size="3">Mike:</font></b></font><font size="3"></font><font size="3"> heres a bit more to it...comprised of ideas i had and ones Will and Dwayne tossed in</font><br>
<font color="#cc0000"><font size="2">(12:47:47 PM) </font><b><font size="3">Mike:</font></b></font><font size="3"></font><font size="3"> Suggestions &amp; Ideas:</font><br>
<font size="3">Using the stealth field to get past certain enemies or obstacles that Allisa would not be able to pass by normally. Stealth field needed to defeat the hidden alpha that gaurds the area the field was found in. The player may even encounter enemies that would hide themselves or thier weak points the moment they see Allisa. The stealth field will nullify this and allow her to move around casually with such foes.</font><br>
<font size="3">The stealth field renders Allisa transparent to the player but virtually invisible to enemies. However if she attacks or fires a weapon, the enemies on screen will be alerted to her presence and attack the spot the shot came from. So, the player must make use of solid &quot;shoot &amp; move&quot; tactics. The stealth field is not a true force field. Any hits Allisa takes is direct damage that decreases her health or kills her. Also any hit she takes will automatically shut off the field and the player will need to re-enable it.</font><br>
<font size="3">Design, and art direction will lean more towards a realistic-like look. Down to deturing from having platforms that just seem to &quot;float&quot; in mid-air like in games like Metroid. Graphics will be a blend of 2D pixeled work combined with 3D graphical effects, such as lighting, transparency, fog and certain areas having 3D rendered backgrounds. The music direction will be a blend of downtempo and ambient sounds with a space feel. The music will be very faint and low. Whereas it can be heard lightly under other sound effects. Such as wind blowing. The idea is to keep the music from being over-powering in a way that the player easily gets absorbed into the game. Only the theme tracks for the bosses will be played at a louder volume.</font><br>
<font size="3">Number of music tracks estimated for the project, is around 18. 7 for the main zones, 3 for the hidden zones, 3 boss battle tracks, the title track, option menu track. Upgrade acquired track and the ending credits track.</font><br>
<font size="3">There are 2 forms of bosses. &quot;Guardians&quot; which protect key items and &quot;Alphas&quot;. Which are the supreme bosses of an area. Alot of cases guardians may be the creatures protecting essential power ups, like weapons. The power up a player acquires in the vicinity of an alpha, is the player's key hint on how to defeat it.</font><br>
<font size="3">Secret areas that lead to hidden bosses, enemies and items that are non-esssential to beating the game.</font><br>
<font size="3">The zip-lash is primarily used to help propel Allisa to high up, hard to reach areas or cross wide gaps. But, it has another use, in which it allows her to pull objects or pull down walls.</font><br>
<font size="3">There are 7 key zones made up of over 50 diffrent areas. There are 6 alpha boses and the final challenge. Each alpha rules over a zone that may have 2 or 3 guardians. Making a total of 16 of these sub-boss creatures. There are 3 non-essential zones that are hidden levels with their own alphas and guardians. Coming to a total of 3 secret alphas and 5 guardians.</font><br>
<font size="3">The powered up forms of the weapons and some other upgrades are offered by cassandra as options that are only offered once. The reprecussions to taking a power up can effect gameplay mostly in regards to reaching hidden areas(IE: Whereas the strob shot offered a focused burst to power up a device. The Ion gun does not).</font><br>
<font size="3">The cryo-flash is a freeze weapon. It has useful applications beyond being a weapon. If used correctly, it can freeze certain enemies in place for a short amount of time. These frozen enemies can then be used as platforms. Also, things like water gysers or the top of a pool of water can be frozen. Lava gysers and lava pools can be cooled to where they harden to stone.</font><br>
<font size="3">Nearly all powerups are acquired from &quot;investigating&quot; bodies, access terminals and data storage points. There are points that have &quot;essential&quot; data/items on them. They are usually marked with the symbol of a CD or of the item in question. Non-essential data and items are usually not marked.</font><br>
<font size="3">The eviro force field grants full protection from extremely hot &amp; cold areas. But can only slow down the rate of direct damage to the health meter in toxic or radioactive areas and underwater. A rate slower than what it would normally be without or with a different shield. The eviro field will take an extremely heavy toll if the player falls in lava. Only the zero-G forcefield can provide full protection but will take slow amounts of damage from the player being in lava.</font><br>
<font size="3">There are some scenerios where the player will need to wait for Cassandra to analyze data or hack into a device of some sort. Some cases will place the player in situations in which they may find themselves protecting an access terminal from falling rocks in an unstable cavern or defending a datastream becon from a swarm of metal mites. Other twists in gameplay suggested are situations where there are floating drones, like hover mines, floating cannons and lamps that Cassandra can hack into and use to assist Allisa. Such as a scenrio whereas there are very dark rooms the player cannot see in without the ultra-light visor which allows the player to see normally in dark areas. Cassandra may hack into a floating lamp drone and use it to guide Allisa through dark areas. Or hack a nearby black ice vehicle to take out a heavily saturated area or smash through a wall. Another situation can be in regards to a boss battle whereas Cassandra hacks into a large turret and the player uses Allisa to coerce the creature into firing range. Cassandra hits the creature with the cannon knocking it out and revealing its weakpoint long enough for Allisa to get in a few good hits.</font><br>
<font size="3">The plasma bayonette is used for directly attacking creatures with dense shells that protect their bodies from projectile based attacks. Especially ones surrounded by thick layers of ice. But the plasma bayonette can also be used to defrost objects and make various repairs. Such as fuse together damaged circuts or spot weld a metallic object. There can be a point in the game where Allisa must power up a generator device but the power wont flow due to Cassandra detecting that there are spots scattered around in the vicinity where creatures have chewed the cables. Allisa must use the plasma bayonette to fuse the frayed cables back together. However, she must be cautious of what cables she reconnects, as these cables will allow power to flow to various obstacles. Such as Anti-man turrets and electro barriers.</font><br>
<font size="3">All bosses have a health bar that appears near the top middle of the screen. Alphas are the only ones with 2 brackets on their meters. Alphas have 2 distinct attack patterns called &quot;type-1 &amp; 2&quot;. The blue area is where they will stick to type-1 patterns. But once they sustain enough damage that brings their health into the critical red zone. They change to type-2 patterns which are usually more difficult to avoid.</font><br>
<font size="3">Alphas:</font><br>
<font size="3">Rock Worms- The player will come out on a ledge overlooking a large carvern. In the middle of this cavern is a giant rock pillar. with what appears to be 2 rows of loose rocks that look like the ones that can be destroyed by seismic charges going around the middle of it. The floor of this cavern is lined with eggs that hatch into rock larvea. The only way back up if the player falls down is to use the seismi-charges to create foot holds on the wall and climb back up to the ledge that opened into the room. The rocks that line the middle of the pillar must be shot with the seismi-charge. This will disturb the rock worms that made the cavern their rookery. Once disturbed they will crawl all around and over the pillar. Once the player jumps from the ledge and onto the pillar in the opening left from the rock worms. The the battle starts and the ledge that the player came into the cavern on crumbles away. The platform the worms made in the pillar is a set path that rotates all around the pillar. Therefore, until the battle ends, the player is stuck on this platform that only rotates around when the player chooses to move left or right. The worms share the same life bar. The worms do not really directly attack Allisa but they move around in patterns that can do damage to her if the player does not evade them. The player must use the seismi-charge to break the rocks that make up the worm's bodies. This does not lower the life bar and can be time consuming as the worm's bodies are made up of 5 stone segments and the head which cannot be damaged. One hit on each segment from the seismi-charge is enough to crack open the stone segments and reveal the vitals. The player cannot attack these vitals singularly by segment. All vitals on each worm must be exposed. As attacking them singularly will not damage the worms enough and they will heal themselves. Once this is completed, the player must switch to the acquired nano rocket launcher and use its ability to target up to 5 things at once. The player must target and hit the 5 exposed segments of either worm at once. Once the boss meter hits the critical zone, 1 of the worms will die and fall to the ground. The remaining one goes berserk and switches to a type-2 attack pattern in which it starts moving faster making it harder to target the sections. Also, it will at occasion run along the ceiling causing rocks to falls down onto Allisa. Once the battle is over. The pillar stops rotating and the player can now get off it. </font><br>
<font size="3">Magmadon- The player falls into a small lava chamber onto a small floating rock platform with lava falls in the backdrop. Magmadon appears as a huge brain like creature that lives in the lava river. It draws the lava over it to make a gigantic crocodile-like body around it. This creature's attack pattern starts off with it, jumping high over the floating rock droping flames onto Allisa. The flames stay where they land for 3secs and can still do damage to her. Magmadon then rears up and slams all its weight onto the platform causing allisa to start sliding towards it's mouth and lowering the platform into the lava. The creature is invunerable to any other weapon but the newly acquired cryo-flash. The player must fire the cryo-flash enough times to cause the creature's head to harden to stone. Once hardened enough the player can just use a kenetic field dash or a seismi-charge to break the stone and expose the brain creature which any attack is able to work its life down. After 3secs of the bombardment, the creature will release the platform and drop back into the lava. After, this, the screen will shake and magmadon will rise up near a far wall and drop back into the lava. Creating a large tidal wave that can knock Allisa into the lava. After jumping over this, the creature will resume its type-1 attack pattern till its life is lowered enough to trigger the type-2 patterns. At this point the creature then begins, leaping over the platform with more force. Not only still dropping flames onto Allisa but creating a tidal wave as it lands back in the lava. It will rear up and slam onto the platform again and the player must continue using the same tactics as before. The player must repeat this until magmadon's life bar is emptied. After its defeat, the flow of lava in the background slows and the lava on the side walls stop. Causing the pool of lava the floating platform was in to harden to stone that the player can safely cross.</font><br>
<font size="3">Hang-Crab Mother- The player comes into the generator room and everything is cocooned. There is a group of hang-crabs swarming around what appears to be a harge ball. The ball will drop and rise from the cieling on a thread of web-like material. The player must use the plasma bayoneete to hack away the hang-crabs but be wary that any hits scored to the ball coccon they are on will cause it to sway. If the ball gains too much momentum, it will knock Allisa back. After the hang-crabs are cleared away, the player can then focus on using the plasma bayonette on the coccon itself. With each hit the hardened shell-like material will start cracking. But this will also drive more crabs out of it that must be hacked away again. After enough hits from the plasma bayonette is scored on the ball, a huge gaping hole forms up. The player then must switch over to the newly acquired strobe shot and fire it directly in the hole. This will electricute all the hang-crabs scurrying around the ball. The ball will then fall directly to the floor and smash the hardened coccon to pieces and reveal the Hang-Crab Mother with more offspring clinging to her and begin the real battle. The creature's type-1 attack consist of it 1st rising back up to the ceiling and starting to coccon itself into another ball. While doing this, hang-crabs will start coming out from her running along the ceiling and walls to the floor. After, the cocoon is complete, the creature then drops back down and more crabs start gathering around the ball. Same as how the fight began, the player must use the same technique while avoiding getting hit by the swaying ball.</font><br>

<font color="#cc0000"><font size="2">(2:09:25 PM) </font><b><font size="3">Mike:</font></b></font><font size="3"></font><font size="3"> i was able to re-think those concepts</font><br>

<font color="#cc0000"><font size="2">(2:10:46 PM) </font><b><font size="3">Mike:</font></b></font><font size="3"></font><font size="3"> not looking to make the next fable or halo...but i do want to say we made some stuff that gamers really enjoyed</font><br>
