	<h3>21, Game Theory, and Descision Trees</h3>
	Just this past weekend I went on a date with my beautiful wife to see a movie. It was a movie that I, at first, had my doubts about even liking. What does going on a date have to do with software engineering? Well for one, how many software engineers do you know who get to escort a beautiful girl to the movie theater and sit next to her? Anyway, the movie we went to see is 21, which was recently released to theaters. I had my doubts about it because it...

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	So, here I am, writing a blog. This isn't my first attempt, but thanks to Chris Pirillo, I have gained some insight to blogging. The one that has influenced me the most to give it another go is, "pick a niche". So to introduce myself, I am a software engineer through my career as well as my hobby. I enjoy writing software, participating in software development projects, designing software, programming the nitty gritty...
