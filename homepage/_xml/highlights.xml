		I have decided once again that it is time to show off my web design abilities using my simple web site. So I gave my site a new face. I keep trying to make it more and more modular, and slowly, each time I redo it, it gets a little bit better. Luckily I have that luxury, namely the one wherein I can redo this web site at any time I want to. I have had an idea for a while also that I want to post my web-based applications and projects on my home page, but so far I haven't. That's what the Web Portfolio page is for. Once I get it put together I'll notify everybody here on this page. Also in the past I have had several other categories on my web site, which I have since removed. I want to bring them back but make them less obtrusive and a little cleaner, so watch for that. This is so much fun for me and I hope you enjoy my new layout. Thanks.
