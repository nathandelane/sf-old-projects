<div id="personalCalculatorOuterContainer" class="innerContainer">
	<h1>Personal Calculator</h1>
	Personal Calculator or "PC" was developed in the tradition of other text-mode calculator programs. As of yet it doesn't include a full set of features that perhaps bc includes, but the direction is similar. One of the major differences in this calculator is that it is developed in Java.
	<br/><br/>
	PC utilizes Polish Postfix Notation to perform calculations, as is described on the homepage for it. In some cases I hack the usage of Polish Postfix Notation in order to allow non-arithmetic operations such as creating matrices or running functions.

<div id="adannaOuterContainer" class="innerContainer">
	<h1>Adanna</h1>
	Adanna is a framework written in Ruby for running Watir tests written in Ruby. The framework includes three components, namely an interface to a database (both MySQL and MSSQL are currently supported), a server agent, and a client agent.
	<br/><br/>
	Adanna was designed to fill in the pieces that Mercury Quick Test Professional provided but that Watir was never meant to provide. It is one of the frameworks talked about in the Watir forums and user groups and on the Watir podcasts.

<div id="ufooarOuterContainer" class="innerContainer">
	<h1>Ufooar</h1>
	U.F.O.O.A.R. stands for Uno For OpenOffice And Ruby. It is essentially an Uno-Ruby bridge for OpenOffice.org. This project stemmed out of my endeavors as a Software Automation Architect. Ufooar came as a result of some fellow testers wanting a way to use OpenOffice.org's Spreadsheet program as a data source for some of their tests. Ufooar has since grown into much more, and has become its own automation project.
