				<h3>My Family</h3>
				Family has always been a very important part of my heritage, and family will always continue to be very 
				important to me I believe. One of the reasons that family is so important to me is because I value my 
				coexistence, but probably the most influential reason that family is important to me is my religious 
				belief that 1) the family is ordained of God, and 2) the family is the fundamental unit of society. I also 
				strongly believe that

				In my family I do not only include my immediate family, my immediate relatives, and the family I married into, 
				but I also include my best friends as family members. They are invited to everything that we do as family. 
				Friends are a very integral part of this life also I believe, and they are very important to our relationship 
				with others. Also friends are often able to give less biased more sound advice than are close relatives or in-
				laws. Below I have attempted to somewhat construct a family tree to illistrate my relationships in my family.
